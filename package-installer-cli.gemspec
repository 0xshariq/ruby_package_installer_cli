    ðŸŽ‰ Package Installer CLI has been installed successfully!
    
    ðŸ“‹ System Requirements:
    âœ… Ruby >= 2.6.0 (detected)
    âš¡ Node.js >= 18.0.0 (required for CLI functionality)
    
    ðŸš€ Quick Start:
      pi create        # Create a new project interactively
      pi analyze       # Analyze existing project with dashboard
      pi doctor        # Run system diagnostics
      pi --help        # Show all available commands
    
    ðŸ”§ If dependencies installation failed, run the automated script:
      SCRIPT_PATH=$(dirname $(gem which package_installer_cli))/../install_dependencies.sh
      bash "$SCRIPT_PATH"
    
    ðŸ’¡ If 'pi' command is not found, add gem binaries to PATH:
      echo 'export PATH="$(gem environment | grep "EXECUTABLE DIRECTORY" | cut -d: -f2 | tr -d " "):$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
      source ~/.bashrc
    
    ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting:
      â€¢ Run 'pi doctor' to diagnose issues  
      â€¢ Use automated script for dependency installation
      â€¢ Visit: https://github.com/0xshariq/ruby_package_installer_cli#-troubleshooting
      â€¢ Issues: https://github.com/0xshariq/ruby_package_installer_cli/issues
    
    ðŸ’Ž Happy coding with Package Installer CLI!
