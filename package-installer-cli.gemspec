    ðŸŽ‰ Package Installer CLI has been installed successfully!
    
    ðŸ“‹ System Requirements:
    âœ… Ruby >= 2.6.0 (you're good to go!)
    âœ… All dependencies are bundled - no additional setup required!
    
    ðŸš€ Quick Start:
      pi create        # Create a new project interactively
      pi analyze       # Analyze existing project structure
      pi doctor        # Run system diagnostics
      pi --help        # Show all available commands
    
     If 'pi' command is not found, add gem binaries to PATH:
      echo 'export PATH="$(gem environment | grep "EXECUTABLE DIRECTORY" | cut -d: -f2 | tr -d " "):$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
      source ~/.bashrc
